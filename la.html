        <p> Disney California Adventure Land. Disneyland must be the most yearning place for every people when they are chirldren. Although I am already twenty years old, it is still a place that my heart yearns for. It is the place where fairy tales can come true, where people can be grateful and embrace goodness, where people can believe that goodness will always triumph over evil, and where people can believe that there will be good rewards for their efforts. People all across the world come to this place, laughig, playing, and celebrating. </p>
        <p>Fun facts: We did four roller coasters in a row at Disneyland.</p>
